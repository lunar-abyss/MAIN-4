# MAIN-4 Fantasy Computer
-------------------------

## Overview
*MAIN-4* is a *4-bit fantasy computer*, designed for "funny" *assembly* programming. The main concept is about *"evolving"* and programming everything in *"DIY mode"*.

*"Evolving"* means that MAIN-4 will get *updates regularly*. For example, now there is *no sound*, but in some next updates it *will appear*, or now framerate is *16 fps*, but after few updates its *24 fps*, hope you got it.

*"DIY mode"* means that there is *no built-in* text editors, OS or even high-level programming language compiler, only *you, your brains and assembly code*, which will help you *create all of the above*.

*Inspired by* 4BoD, Micro Vision and TIC-80

*Made in C* with using *SDL2*.
